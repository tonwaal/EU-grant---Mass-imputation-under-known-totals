# EU-grant---Mass-imputation-under-known-totals

These files contain R code for mass imputation of categorial data given known totals. The code has been developed for the project "Multivariate Mass Imputation for the Population Census Given Known Totals (2018-NL-ESS.VIP.BUS.ADMIN)". This project was sponsored by Eurostat under the call "Multipurpose statistics for efficiency gains in production".

The file "ImputationCode parallel def.R" contains the code for (mass) imputing categorial data given known totals.

This code has been parallelized in order to speed up the simulation study.

The file "Calculate quality measures def.R" contains R code for calculating quality measures. This code has been used for a simulation study.

For more information about the developed methodology and the simulation study, see the final deliverable of the project: "Multivariate Mass Imputation for the Population Census Given Known Totals - Deliverable 3: Final results". 

This deliverable is available on request. Please send an email to Ton de Waal (tonwaal@gmail.com) for this deliverable or for more information on the developed methodology or R code.
